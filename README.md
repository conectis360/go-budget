# Personal Finance API in Go

This project is a **Personal Finance API** built in Go, focusing on idiomatic Go programming principles. The design emphasizes simplicity, leveraging **Go routines** and Go's built-in libraries, without the use of frameworks.

The project's foundations and practices are inspired by the book _"Learning Go: Idiomatic Go"_ by Jon Bodner, which encourages a clean, idiomatic approach to Go development.

## Features

- **Simple, clean architecture**: No frameworks, just Go routines and idiomatic Go code.
- **Personal Finance**: Handles operations like budget tracking, expense categorization, and balance calculations.
- **Concurrency with Go routines**: Efficient handling of multiple tasks in parallel.
- **Error handling**: Robust and idiomatic error handling throughout the codebase.
